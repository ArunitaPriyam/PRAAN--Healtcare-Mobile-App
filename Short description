Short Description

What’s the problem?
As the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing, there is an urgent need to have a sustainable & successful healthcare system to provide the best treatment to COVID patients during crisis.
In today’s condition, if people are infected and need hospitalisation, they/their family members have to run from pillar to post to look for nearby facilities.
The ambiguity for family members of patients to reach the hospital which shall accommodate patients in the first go is creating a panic situation. Due to which they are not able to reach the hospitals on time leading to loss of their loved ones.
The idea
Henceforth, to reduce the fatality rate of our loved ones, our vision is to develop a system that answers the following questions:
1.	Where is the centralized system to give access to essential required information of nearby available hospitals and other healthcare facilities?
2.	How does COVID-19 patients and families get details of available hospitals, ventilators, mobile mortuary vans, ambulances, etc. in one-click without any delay?
3.	How government bodies are informed if the hospitals are running out of essential healthcare facilities in any specific area?
